# Backend

This repository contains the backend code for the project.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the backend, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/backend-repo.git`

Then switch to directory

`cd backend-repo`

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Node.js installed. Install the required dependencies:

`npm install`

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root directory if one does not already exist. Copy the example configuration from .env.example and update with your environment-specific values:

`cp .env.example .env`

Edit the .env file with your environment-specific configuration, such as database credentials and API keys.

### 4. Start the Backend Server

Run the following command to start the backend server:

`npm run start`

The backend server should now be running and accessible at http://localhost:2000 (or another port if configured differently).
